                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                    course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a
                    Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                    ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of experience. It certainly helped me land a job as
                    a full-stack 100% recommend! ‚Äù
